# KDE Frames Animator
Frames animator from GIF. Responds to clicking on the area - plays another animation

## How to use
1. Install the plasmoid
2. Prepare horizontal(!) sprite sheets from .gif (use any converters or graphics editors). The vertical sprite sheet is not working yet!
3. Set the number of frames and FPS for each sprite sheet in the settings.
4. Enter the path to the sprite sheets

## Known Issues
1. Incorrect image proportions with different picture sizes
2. There is no automatic determination of the number of frames in the sprite sheet
3. Unable to use .gif image (only sprite sheets)
